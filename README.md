> [View this boilerplate on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/7899m)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository and then navigate into the cloned directory

```bash
git clone https://github.com/One-Nexus/Synergy-Boilerplate.git && cd Synergy-Boilerplate
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server

```bash
npm start
```

4. ...happy coding!

Access the devlopment server in the browser (default port is 8080, so visit http://localhost:8080). Start looking through the sample module and theme code - make some changes and see them reflected in your browser instantly!

To bundle your application, run `npm run build`. The application bundle will be created at `./dist/app.js`.

### Sample Modules

This boilerplate provides 2 sample modules to get started with, [`MyModule`](https://github.com/One-Nexus/Synergy-Boilerplate/tree/master/src/modules/MyModule) which is split into multiple files, and [`Accordion`](https://github.com/One-Nexus/Synergy-Boilerplate/blob/master/src/modules/Accordion.jsx), which exists as a single file. This is so you can get a feel for the two most ssignificant ways to construct modules so you can decide which you prefer.
